The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant. Saving the world with meals on wheels.

It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?

Did I mention we have comfy chairs? No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.
