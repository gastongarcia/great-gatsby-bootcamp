You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?

You've swallowed a planet! I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.

Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you? I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.

They're not aliens, they're Earthâ€¦liens! Saving the world with meals on wheels. No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.
